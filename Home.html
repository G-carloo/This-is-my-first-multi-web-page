<h1> This is Home </h1>

 <p><b><i>Is where I was born and raised so don't you dare disrespect it boy.
     If you were mine I would beat your ass silly.
     Anyway before I was so rudely interupted, This is my Home.
     Born and raised, I loved it here. No matter how bad things got for me the people were supportive.
     If I could I would go back. Back in time to where the only things that mattered were food and family.
     Now all that matters is food. Family is gone.
